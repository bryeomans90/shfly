Dependent variable: Product category they're likely to order next time they come to the site

Input:
    Previous Purchase: 1 hot encoding of all items purchased
    Session Start Time: Month, DOW, Hour
    Sequence of Events: that occurred in the sesion

Approach #1 - Double LSTM
    Unique at Order Level
    Input:
        2 Channel LSTM:
            Previous N Purchases:
                [month, dow, hour, purchase category 2]
            Previous M Sessions:
                [month, dow, hour, event1, event2]
        Order Date: Month, DOW, Hour
    Output: Product Category Purchased

Approach #2 - Purchase History LSTM
    Unique at Order Level
    Input:
        Array of Last 30 Purchases
            [month, days since, purchase category 2]
    Output: Product Category Purchased

Approach #3 - Fully Connected Neural Network
    Unique at Order Level
    Input:
        Previous Purchase History(1008):
            Replicate(4X) for: (Last 30 Days) (12 Months Ago) (This Year) (Everytime Else)
            Variables:
                # of Purchases in each product category 252
        Session Count Columns (92):
            Replicate(4X) for: (Last 30 Days) (12 Months Ago) (Rest of Year) (Everytime Else)
            Variables:
                # Event 1 for all 10 categories
                # Event 2 for all 10 categories
                # # of category obs for all 3 categories
    Output: Product Category Purchased

Abstract Idea:
    If they came to the site multiple times then we want to capture that information in a sequential model
